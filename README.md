# Text-Editor
Module 19 Challenge - Progressive Web Applications (PWA) - Text Editor

In this challenge, I completed starter code for a text editor that runs in the browser. Many challenges came up, but were handled to the best of my ability. The acceptance criteria met in this challenge were:
<ul>The application has a client server folder structure.</ul>
<ul>"npm run start" starts up the backend and serves the client.</ul>
<ul>JavaScript files are bundled whenever the text editor application is run from the terminal.</ul>
<ul>When webpack plugins are run, there is a generated HTML file, service worker, and a manifest file.</ul>
<ul>The text editor still functions in the browser without errors when using next-gen JavaScript.</ul>
<ul>The IndexedDB immediately creates a database storage when the text editor is opened.</ul>
<ul>Content in the text editor is saved with IndexedDB.</ul>
<ul>Content is retrieved from the IndexedDB when reopening the text editor.</ul>
<ul>Clicking the install button downloads a web application as an icon on the desktop.</ul>
<ul>There is a registered service worker using workbox when the web application is loaded.</ul>
<ul>When the service worker is registered, the static assets pre cached are loaded.</ul>
